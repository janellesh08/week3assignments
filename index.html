    <h1>Janelle's 90's Movies Hub</h1></div>

    <div id = "paragraph"><p>Here, you'll find all of the classic 90's movies starring your favorites. These movies have influenced
        culture as well as represent a moment in time that will never be recreated. I've spent my life watching
        them all and curating this collection of my personal favorites. I hope that you enjoy them as much as I 
        continue to do. 

        Now...grab some popcorn and a group of friends or some wine and your SOS, and sit back and enjoy!
