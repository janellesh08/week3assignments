    <h1>Love Jones</h1>
    <p>Love Jones is a 1997 American romantic drama film written and directed by Theodore Witcher, in his feature film debut. It stars Larenz Tate, Nia Long, Isaiah Washington, Bill Bellamy, and Lisa Nicole Carson.
        Two of the poems recited by Nia Long's character, Nina, were written by Sonia Sanchez and are included in her book Like the Singing Coming Off the Drums: Love Poems.        
        Although the movie received favorable critical reviews, it was not a financial success. It has, however, a cult following for its realistic characters and unorthodox take on the romance genre. It is Theodore Witcher's only directorial work to date.
