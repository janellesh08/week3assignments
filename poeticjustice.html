    <h1>Poetic Justice</h1>
    <p>Poetic Justice is a 1993 American romantic drama film written and directed by John Singleton and starring Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur with Regina King and Joe Torry. Maya Angelou, who wrote the poems featured in the film, appears as one of the three elderly sisters whom the characters meet at a roadside family reunion. The Last Poets appear toward the end of the film. The plot of the movie is based on Tupac's brief romance with Ann Marie Rose, now Ann Marie Adams, with whom he struck up a relationship in between takes on the set of the film Juice, in which he starred. Adams, an aspiring poet who frequented the Brooklyn Moon cafe in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, was a student at Brooklyn College known for her trademark braids.

        Poetic Justice reached No. 1 in the box office its opening weekend, grossing $11,728,455. It eventually grossed a total of $27,515,786. Jackson received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Original Song for "Again", which also reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was later referenced in Kendrick Lamar's single "Poetic Justice", which was titled after and based on the film. The song sampled Jackson's "Any Time, Any Place."
        
        Despite mixed reviews from critics, the film has a cult following, especially for the chemistry between Jackson and Shakur
